C++:
  If you want the one that creates files on the computer use Tims Adventures.uef.exe, otherwise use Tims Adventures.exe
Visual Basic Script:
  I just made a version you can use, run Msgs.vbs for it to do the background and stuff (also i have not tested the background changing thing), but if you just   want the messages just run JustMsgs.vbs
